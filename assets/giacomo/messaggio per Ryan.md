Hi Ryan! I just wanted to confirm that I will be landing in Miami International Airport on the 23rd April at 4 PM!!
Shall I get to the Studio with some public transport or can you come and pick me up?

I would need you to check the e-mail I sent you so that I can eventually get well organized with the (few) things I will bring with me. I plan to fly with a backpack and a hand lagguage.

Wish you a great day!

Giacomo
