Good morning Ryan!
I am finalizing the last stuff and I got few questions for you:

- Is there a coffe machine with some sort of capsule?
	- if yes how much is a capsule 
- Is there a car that I could use to move around in Miami for our businesses?
- Do you have dj mixing equipment in the studio?
- I have a MacStudio, shall I bring my screen? Or is it better I buy a new one there? I think to be able to take my screen I will have to pay more for the ticket as I am looking for no-baggage flight, only hand-baggage and a backpack
- at which times is usually the studio booked?
- how much is an entire day in the studio?
- can I use the studio B to do online courses?
- can you send me a picture of the wall power connections so that I can buy the correct adapter for my computer?
- do we have a little budget to buy some hardware to do a server in the office?
	- if yes how much? (we don't need a fancy server, actually we shall use a mono-board pc which are pretty chip)

I should be leaving on the 23rd April or the 29th, the plane lends at 4pm.

Wish you a great day and can't wait to be there!
