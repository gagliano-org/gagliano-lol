// in one go by calling the constructor of the current class and
// passing the current object as the constructor's argument.
// Performing all the actual copying in the constructor helps to
// keep the result consistent: the constructor will not return a
// result until the new object is fully built; thus, no object
// can have a reference to a partially-built clone.
